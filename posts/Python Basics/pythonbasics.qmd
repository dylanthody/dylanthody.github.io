## Variables

A value is datum (literal) such as a number or text.

There are different types of values:

* 323.3 is known as a float or double;
* 22 is an integer
* "Hello World!" is a string.

```{python}
a = 10
print(a)
```

Here we are going to define a list containing elements of different data types

```{python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
#Print the entire list
print(list_example)
```

```{python}
string_one = "This is an example "
string_two = "of string concatenation"
#all of the basic operators we see in math are available to use
# + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication
# ** for exponent/powers, / for division, // for integer division
string_full = string_one + string_two
#this works as you would expect on numbers
print(string_full)
```

It works for lists too

```{python}
#it works for lists too
list_one = ["apples", "oranges"]
list_two = ["pears", "satsumas"]
list_full = list_one + list_two
print(list_full)
```
