# Showcasing only wedding playlist

For all you readers out there looking forward to getting married, I sorted this to only show you wedding songs...

You're welcome 

```{r}
selected_playlist_1 <- c("Wedding")
wedding_subset <- subset(spotify, playlist_name %in% selected_playlist_1)
```

```{r}
#| results: asis
rmarkdown::paged_table(wedding_subset)
```

# Mom's, this one is for you

For the last data set, I will separate all the songs in the "Mom's playlist" so they now always have got something to listen to

Once again.. you're welcome

```{r}
selected_playlist_2 <- c("Mom's playlist")
mom_subset <- subset(spotify, playlist_name %in% selected_playlist_2)
```

```{r}
#| results: asis
rmarkdown::paged_table(mom_subset)
```
